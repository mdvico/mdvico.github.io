Hi, my name is MatÃ­as Daniel Vico and this is my personal landing page. Welcome.

I'm 30 years old, I was born in Argentina (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·) and I am currently working as a Physical Design engineer (so I help making the physical side of micro-chips) at Marvell.

This will be the place where I post everything I find interesting, useful and/or a guide to the future me (hopefully for someone else) on several topic. Please, don't expect periodicity of any kind.

You can find me on Twitter [@HerrFusion](https://twitter.com/HerrFusion).

See you around!
